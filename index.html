    <h2>Profile</h2>
   

    <p>With ten years of experience as a teacher, I have recently become interested in programming, a new way to connect with others and help clients. As a first-generation student in my family, I am motivated to upgrade my knowledge and embrace challenges with a growth mindset. My career trajectory has demonstrated strong motivation for self-improvement, and my work experience of working with people from different backgrounds and with diverse learning needs has helped me develop excellent communication skills, research skills as well as problem-solving skills. I am seeking the position of Web Developer to contribute my skills and expertise.</p>
